# Star Wars API Character/Movie Guide

## Assignment Overview

This project involves working in pairs to research the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and create a character/movie guide. The guide will display a list of at least 10 Star Wars characters. Each character name will function as a link to a movie they appeared in. Clicking the character's name will trigger an AJAX request to fetch and display the movie title, opening crawl, and poster in a separate section of the page.

## Requirements
- Fetch Data from SWAPI: Retrieve character information in JSON format.
- Display Character List: Create an unordered list (UL) with at least 10 characters.
- Link Characters to Movies: Clicking a characterâ€™s name should make an AJAX call to retrieve:
  - Movie title
  - Opening crawl
  - Movie poster (images must be sourced and stored in an images folder)
- Responsiveness: The guide must be fully responsive across mobile and desktop.
- Enhancements: Use GreenSock (GSAP) animations and HTML Template elements or template literals.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for failed AJAX requests.
- Loading Indicator: Include a loading icon while fetching data.

## Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API & AJAX
- GreenSock (GSAP) for animations
- Git/GitHub for version control

## Usage Guide
- The page initially loads a list of characters.
- Clicking a character's name fetches and displays their movie information.
- The movie title, opening crawl, and poster appear in a separate section.
- If the request fails, an error message is displayed.
- A loading icon appears while data is being fetched.
- GreenSock animations enhance user interactions.
